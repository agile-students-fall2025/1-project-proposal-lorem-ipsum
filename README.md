# Campus Asset Management Platform (CAMP)

## What and Why?

The **Campus Asset Management Platform (CAMP)** is a mobile-friendly web application designed to centralize and simplify the borrowing, reserving, and management of items across university facilities such as the IM Lab, Arts Centre, and Library.

Currently, students rely on fragmented systems—or in many cases, manual tracking—for checking out items like cameras, laptops, sports gear, or arts equipment. This creates common problems:

* Students forget return deadlines.
* Staff manually track overdue items.
* Students have no easy way to check availability or reserve in advance.
* Communication gaps cause inefficiency and frustration.

**CAMP solves these challenges by bringing everything into one platform** with automated reminders, real-time availability, and secure transactions. The result: students and staff save time while improving accountability, transparency, and convenience.

## For Whom?

**Primary Users**

* **Students**: who borrow campus resources (e.g., cameras, lab kits, sports gear).
* **Staff**: responsible for issuing and managing items at different locations.

**Secondary Users**

* **University administrators**: who benefit from data insights for resource planning and optimization.

## How?

From an end-user perspective, **CAMP** will provide:

* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Login with university NetID credentials.
* **Centralized inventory:** Browse all available items across departments in one place.
* **Pre-booking system:** Reserve items in advance with confidence.
* **Real-time notifications:**

  * Reminders before return deadlines.
  * Alerts to staff about overdue items.
  * Notifications when a desired item is back in stock.
* **Payment integration:** Secure campus cash payments for fees or penalties.
* **Ratings & reviews:** Students can review equipment and service quality.
* **Cross-platform access:** Mobile-friendly web interface for both students and staff.

**Example scenario:**
A student needs a DSLR camera for a photography project. Using CAMP, they log in with SSO, check real-time availability, reserve the camera from the Arts Centre for next Friday, get reminders for pickup and return deadlines, and the staff can instantly see records of issued items.
