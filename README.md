# Campus Item Management Platform (CIMP)

## What and Why?

The **Campus Item Management Platform (CIMP)** is a mobile-friendly web application designed to centralize and simplify the process of borrowing, reserving, and managing items across university facilities such as the **IM Lab**, **Arts Centre**, and **Library**.  

Currently, students rely on fragmented systemsâ€”or in many cases, manual tracking for checking out items like cameras, laptops, sports gear, or arts equipment. This leads to common problems:
- Students forget return deadlines.
- Issuers manually track overdue items.
- Students have no easy way to check item availability or reserve in advance.
- Communication gaps cause inefficiency and frustration on both ends.

CIMP solves these problems by **bringing everything into one platform** with **automated reminders**, **real-time availability**, and **secure transactions**, ensuring students and staff save time while improving accountability and convenience.

## For Whom?

- **Primary Users**:  
  - University students who borrow equipment or resources (e.g., cameras, lab kits, sports gear).  
  - Staff responsible for issuing and managing items at different campus locations.  

- **Secondary Users**:  
  - Campus administration departments seeking usage data for resource planning.

## How?

From an end-user perspective, CIMP will provide:  

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** login using university NetID credentials.  
- **Centralized inventory**: Browse all available items across departments in one place.  
- **Pre-booking system**: Students can reserve items in advance.  
- **Real-time notifications**:
  - Remind students before the return deadline.  
  - Notify staff about overdue items.  
  - Alert students when a desired item is back in stock.  
- **Payment integration**: Secure campus cash payments for equipment fees or penalties.  
- **Ratings & reviews**: Students can review equipment and service quality.  
- **Cross-platform access**: Mobile-friendly web interface for both students and staff.  

Example scenario:  
> A student needs a DSLR camera for a photography project. Using CIMP, they log in with SSO, reserve a camera from the Arts Centre for next Friday, get reminders on pick-up and return deadlines, and the staff sees real-time records of issued items.
